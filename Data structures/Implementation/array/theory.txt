1. Array:
    - An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
    - Stores multiple items of the same data type.
    - Easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value.

2. Arrays in Python:
    - Array in Python can be implemented using the following ways:
        - list
        - array

    - array(data type,value list) : function which is in array module is used create an array with specific data type and and value list.

        Type Code	C Type	                Python Type         Minimum size in Bytes

        ‘b’	        signed char	            int	                1
        ‘B’	        unsigned char	        int	                1
        ‘u’	        Py_UNICODE              unicode character	2
        ‘h’	        signed short	        int	                2
        ‘H’	        unsigned short	        int	                2
        ‘i’	        signed int	            int	                2
        ‘I’	        unsigned int	        int	                2
        ‘l’	        signed long	            int	                4
        ‘L’	        unsigned long	        int                 4
        ‘q’	        signed long long	    int	                8
        ‘Q’	        unsigned long long	    int	                8
        ‘f’	        float	                float	            4
        ‘d’	        double	                float	            8

    - example: 
        #initializes array with signed integers
        import array
        arr = array.array("i",[1,2,3])

3. Operations on array:
    - append()      add the value/list of values (as argument) at the end of the array.
    - insert(i,x)   add the value(x) at the ith position specified in its argument.
    - pop(i)        removes the element at ith position mentioned in its argument and returns it.
    - remove(x)     remove the first occurrence of the value(x) mentioned in its arguments.
    - index(x)      returns the index of the first occurrence of value(x) mentioned in arguments.
    - reverse()     reverses the array.

    -example:
        import array
        arr = array.array("i",[1,2,3])
        arr.append(4)

        #appended array : 1 2 3 4

4. Types of problems:
    -Array Rotations
    -Arrangement Rearrangement
    -Order Statistics
    -Range Queries
    -Searching and Sorting
    -Optimization Problems
    -Matrix
    -Misc
